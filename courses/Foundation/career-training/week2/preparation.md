Separate some of your assignments and projects into their own repositories to showcase them. Perform this as a combination of copy/pasting from your assignment repo and using git commands - which will provide some great git practice (look into the `git clone` and `git remote add` commands)! Each new repo should have a comprehensive title and a nice short description.
