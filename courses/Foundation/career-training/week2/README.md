# Career Training (Week 2)

In this interactive online session, we explore how **CVs, LinkedIn profiles, and GitHub accounts** complement each other in the eyes of recruiters and hiring managers - particularly within the tech industry.

We will focus on:

- The **distinct role** each platform plays in showcasing your professional identity:
  - The **CV** as your structured, tailored overview for specific roles
  - **LinkedIn** as your living, network-driven professional brand
  - **GitHub** as evidence of your practical coding abilities and collaboration skills
- What **recruiters typically look for** on each platform, including consistency across them, clarity of skills and achievements, and active engagement (especially on GitHub for developer roles).

Participants then split into **breakout groups** to review and give feedback on fictional CVs and LinkedIn profiles, using real-life examples to reflect on how effectively these platforms represent their professional value.

These articles, videos and tasks are not a suggestion, but mandatory. They require less time than your regular homeworks, but are just as important. We expect you to use the remainder of your 30 hours on finishing all the assignments you haven't yet completed.
