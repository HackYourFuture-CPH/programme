# Lesson Plan

## Session Goal

Guide trainees to understand how their CV, LinkedIn, and GitHub should work in harmony to present a complete and professional image to recruiters. Provide tools, examples, and hands-on practice in critiquing and improving their online presence.

### 1. Review All Materials

Familiarize yourself with [all the content that we ask trainees to prepare for](preparation.md). Specifically:

- The reading preparation
- The LinkedIn and GitHub examples provided
- Test the CodeWars Kata collection to ensure you can answer any technical questions

### 2. Update & Review Your Own Professional Profiles (Optional but Helpful)

Bring up-to-date and share your own GitHub, LinkedIn, or CV (if comfortable) as an example to increase trust and demonstrate transparency.

### 3. Prepare Examples for Breakout Review

Select 1â€“2 fictional or anonymized real CVs and LinkedIn profiles with common issues (e.g. vague language, inconsistent job dates, or missing GitHub links).

Prepare guiding questions for breakout rooms:

- Is the professional story coherent across platforms?
- Are skills clearly communicated?
- Is there any missing or confusing information?

Ask each group to identify:

1. Strengths and weaknesses
1. Inconsistencies or red flags
1. Suggestions for improvement
