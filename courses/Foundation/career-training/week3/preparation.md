# Preparation

- What is the "STAR" answer format?
- [Read about the elevator pitch](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-give-an-elevator-pitch-examples) and prepare yours!
- Questions for the end of the interview. Having questions for the interviewer shows engagement and interest. Prepare questions for the interviewer. A few examples:
  - Based on our discussion, what value do you feel I could bring to the team?
  - Are there any gaps in my experience that you are concerned about?
  - What are the next steps and when should I be expecting to hear from you?
  - What is the tech stack of your company?
  - What do the internal processes at your company look like? (workflow, growth plan, onboarding plan)
  - What is the team composition? (the team you are interviewing for)
  - What is the most important trait of the position?
  - Questions that matter to you (depends on your personal circumstances, maybe you would like to work remotely, maybe you would like to have a mentor, etc.)
