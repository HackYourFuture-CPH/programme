# Lesson Plan

## Session Goal

Equip trainees with a realistic understanding of the job search process and what is expected beyond technical proficiency. Clarify how HYF can support them, and where its boundaries lie. Set the foundation for professional self-presentation and awareness of the Danish job market structure.

## Your Preparation (Before Session)

### 1. Familiarize Yourself with Materials

Thoroughly read the [same preparation](preparation.md) as the trainees.

Regarding understanding Unions, contact PROSA for a short presentation.

> [!NOTE]
> It is NOT your job to be an expert on the matter of unions, A-kasser and employment contracts! A representative from PROSA are usually happy to provide trainees with an overview of these.

### 2. Review Responses to the "Career Status" Survey

Before class, check submissions in the class Slack channel or survey tool.

Use these responses to:

- Tailor examples to trainees situations
- Identify trainees needing more support
- Initiate relevant 1-on-1 conversations

### 3. Prepare Slide Deck

Include:

1. Summary of key soft vs. hard skills
1. Overview of Danish employment structures (Union, A-Kasse, Contracts)
1. Highlights and characteristics of Danish workplace culture and society.
1. Slide deck can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1irh-zDTTg9e001eNx-JlLQ0DibWBDJRyBelmbfwFwgw/edit?usp=sharing).

### 4. Set Expectations Clearly

Be ready to clarify:

- What HYF can support (mentorship, feedback, referrals, skill-building)
- What HYF cannot do (guarantee job placement, write applications for trainees, legal employment advice)
