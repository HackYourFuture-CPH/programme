## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of what a web development project involves (e.g. frontend/backend tasks).
- Experience working on a group project (from HYF or elsewhere).
- Familiarity with Git/GitHub workflows.

## What will we learn?

- The difference between traditional and Agile ways of working (Waterfall vs Agile).
- The core principles of the Agile Manifesto.
- An overview of the Scrum framework: roles, ceremonies (e.g. standup), and artifacts (e.g. backlog, tasks).
- The importance of communication, transparency, and shared responsibility in a software development team.
- How to approach teamwork in an Agile environment, especially as a junior developer.

## Extra practice after session (optional)

1. Write and prioritize your own user stories:
   Think of a simple app (e.g. a task manager, recipe app, or class planner). Write 3 user stories, and prioritize them using the MoSCoW method.

2. Backlog breakdown practice:
   Choose one user story you wrote and break it down into smaller technical tasks (e.g. design a page, set up routing, fetch data, write test).
