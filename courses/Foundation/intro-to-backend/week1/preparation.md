## Installation preparation

### Node

1. Setup `node` on your computer (skip to step 2 to check):
   1. Download from: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   2. Check if node is installed in your system by running the sollowing commands in Command Promt/PowerShell/Git Bash:
      - `node -v`
      - `npm -v`
      - In either case you should see the version of `node` or `npm` installed.
